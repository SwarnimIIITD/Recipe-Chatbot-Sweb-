Boil for about 2-3 minutes. Once the noodles, tend to fluff up, remove from the water, using a slotted spoon and put it into a strainer that's resting on a bowl, to hold the excess water. Do this for all the strips of dough and set aside. Heat a kadai with oil on medium-high heat, gradually add in the boiled noodles, reduce the flame to medium-low and fry ensuring the noodles are cooked and it doesn't get the brown colour. We need our noodles to be crispy, yet be pale in colour and not deep brown. Remove the noodles from the kadai and place it on an absorbent paper to drain out the excess oil. Allow it to cool. To make the Honey Syrup In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, water and honey and bring to a single boil on medium-high flame. Turn off the flame, add the roasted sesame seeds and give it a good mix. Allow this honey syrup to cool down only until it is warm, toss it in the freshly fried noodles until well coated.This is the Darsaan ! Serve the Darsaan with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.Serve Chinese Darsaan Recipe with Ice Cream as dessert after a meal of Dragon Chicken Sizzler Recipe or Sweet and Sour Vegetable Recipe with Tofu & Brown Rice. " ;

	ex:instructions "To begin making the Pita bread we will first have to get your ingredients ready especially the yeast. If you are using active dry yeast (look like small round balls) - follow the instructions given in the packet.If you are using fast action yeast (looks more like fine semolina) then in a large bowl combine the flours, salt and sugar and gradually add in the yeast and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, adding little flour if it tends to get sticky. Once all of the ingredients form a ball; add the olive oil and place the ball on a work surface and knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes. Repeated kneading combines all the ingredients well and will help the bread rise well in the oven.Once you have finished kneading and gained enough arm muscle; place the dough in a large bowl coated with olive oil and cover it with cling wrap/plastic wrap and allow it to rise for about 2 hours.After two hours you will notice that the dough has doubled. At this point punch the dough down and knead gently. Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll each portion into a ball. Place the balls on a baking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth and let them sit for another 30 minutes.While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 250 C. The oven should be preheated for at least half an hour before you can bake the pitas in them. Now it should be time to work your dough into flat bread. Take one ball, dust it with a little flour and dust the work surface as well. Using a rolling pin, roll the pita into an oval or a circle. Make sure the pitas are thin; about 1/8th inch or 1/4 inch thick. Continue the same with the remaining dough balls.Place the rolled portion of pita bread on dusted baking sheets and place it inside the oven. Bake the pita dough until they puff - you will see them rising forming bubbles, to slowly puffing and fully puffing up.The whole process takes a maximum or 3-5 minutes and not more than 5 minutes. If the pita bread does not rise in 5 minutes, then take them out. The Pita Bread will still be cooked, but just wont have pockets and will still taste just as good.You can serve Whole Wheat Pita Bread Recipe along with soups or make it into sandwiches like Egg Bhurji Stuffed Pita Pockets Recipe, Aloo Tikki Stuffed Pita Sandwich Recipe, Pita Sandwich With Cauliflower Falafel And Roasted Vegetables Recipe and more." ;

Whisk them together and set aside while you begin to prep for caramelising the sugar.Heat a heavy bottomed pan, add ghee and once it begins to get hot (not smoking), reduce the heat to medium. Add sugar and level it in ghee using a spatula. After five minutes stir the sugar using a spatula (using spatula helps ensure that the caramel won’t stick to it). Keep stirring once in a while till the sugar starts caramelizing as it melts. (The colour of the caramel should not deepen or darken in colour as this will lead to a bitter tasting halwa)Give a quick stir to the flour-semolina batter and slowly add it to the caramelised sugar.Now, starts the tricky part. Hold the wok or pan firmly using a cloth or holder (to avoid the heat) so that you can work your way with the batter. Using ladle (a large heavy spoon/ kalchhul), carefully yet swiftly start mixing the batter into the caramel. The batter will seem to turn lumpy but nothing to worry.Increase the flame to medium and using the back of the spoon keep smashing the batter, especially the whitish lumps, till the whole batter gets completed assimilated and incorporated with the caramel and the halwa wears a homogeneous look.This process will take approximately 3 to 4 minutes. You will also notice that the halwa releases the oil as it begins to come together as evenly toned mixture. At this point, remove excess oil in a small bowl and again roast the halwa for 3 to 4 minutes. Switch off the heat and push the halwa towards the edge of one side of the wok to allow any excess ghee to drain in the centre. Once the ghee leaves the halwa, drain it out in the bowl. Halwa is now ready to be served!Serve Mukhadi Halwa as a dessert after your weekday meal of Dal Makhani, Aloo Ki Sabzi and Phulka." ;

Dont cut all the way through. The lines should not reach the edge of the circle (about 1/4 inch from the edge). Think of a slotted spoon !Starting from one end, roll the dough circle . Pinch both the ends and push the ends gently towards the centre. This will fluff up the centre and give the kordoi its characteristic shape like a start fruit. Repeat with all the dough. This measurement makes about 12 such kordoi.Heat oil in a deep frying pan and fry the shaped kordoi in batches until golden brown and crisp. Cool the kordoi, placing them on kitchen towels or tissue to drain excess oil.Meanwhile, make the sugar syrup by bringing the sugar and water to a boil in a saucepan.Simmer for few minutes until syrup is thick and sticky.One by one, drop the kordoi into this syrup, turn over to the other side, and remove. Serve Assamese Sweet Kordoi Recipe warm or cool, paired with Adrak Chai." ;

In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt.Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour. Add little water at a time and knead to make soft, pliable paratha dough. Knead paratha dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next add a teaspoon of oil to coat the paratha dough and knead little more. You want a paratha dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky. Divide the dough into 8 to 10 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you get the filling ready.Pressure cook arbi with 1 cup water and salt for around 4 whistle and switch off the heat.Once it is pressure cooked, allow the pressure to release naturally and peel the skin.Mash the arbi into a coarse lumpy texture with your fingers or a fork. Once mashed, add in the finely chopped green chillies, lots of freshly chopped coriander leaves,  salt to taste, half teaspoon of cumin powder, half a teaspoon of coriander powder, a teaspoon of dry mango powder, 1 teaspoon of garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder and finally if you want it extra spicy, the red chilli powder. Using your fingers again, mix all the ingredients into the arbi until well combined.Divide the arbi filling into 8 to 10 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of arbi paratha dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.The final step is to stuff the filling into the arbi paratha dough.We dust the paratha dough in flour, flatten it with your finger and place it on a flat surface. Roll them out thin to approximately 3 inches in diameter circle.Take a portion of filling and place it in the center. Next Gather the sides of the paratha dough and bring them together. Remove the little excess dough which popped out when you brought them together. Press the filled arbi paratha dough down.Dust the filled arbi paratha dough in some flour and roll it gently applying just a pressure. Roll it to desired thickness and proceed the similar way with the remaining portions of paratha dough and filling.Preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled arbi paratha. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around. Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the arbi parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.Once the arbi paratha is cooked transfer to a plate. Continue to the same process with the remaining parathas the same way.Serve the Stuffed Arbi Paratha Recipe along with Palak Raita Recipe and Amla Mirchi Ka Achari Subzi Recipe by the side to make it a healthy breakfast." ;

Then add tomato puree and cook for 5-10 minutes on a medium heat.When the mix begins to bubble, add the cooked kidney beans/rajma along with the water that was used for cooking it. Stir well.Add Chipotle chilli along with Adobo sauce, crushed cumin and salt. If using red chilli flakes instead, add it now.Mix it all up well and cook to make a thick sauce. This may take 5-7 minutes. Turn off the heat and keep it aside.For the sautéed peppers/vegetables, place a pan on heat, add some oil to it and allow it to get warm.Once done add all the chopped peppers (or any other vegetables that you may like) along with the garlic.Sprinkle salt and sauté for 1-2 minutes. Then, add chilli flakes and oregano, toss together and turn off the heat. Keep aside till ready to use.For the roasted corn salsa, char the corn on the stove top or in a preheated oven. Take the kernels off the cob and put it in a bowl.Add in the rest of the ingredients and mix thoroughly. Keep aside until later use.For the guacamole, prepare the Avocado guacamole but remember that guacamole needs to be eaten fresh, so this is one component that has to be made last, or just before assembling and serving the burrito bowl.To assemble the burrito bowl, if you are preparing one big bowl for your guests, use a fairly deep 8-9” flat bottom bowl or serving dish.A burrito bowl is essentially layered, so begin with the coriander-lime rice. Spread it generously at the base of the bowl.Over it, spoon the spicy beans and spread it around the rice.Next, layer the sauteed peppers over the beans.On top of that goes a layer of guacamole.Spread some corn salsa over it, and top it with the lettuce (if using), cheese and black olives and serve.If you are making individual burrito bowls for a smaller crowd, follow the same sequence of layers, but use smaller sized ramekins for serving.To make a Burrito Bar, simply place all the prepared components on convenient location. Give your guests individual bowls and allow them to choose their favorite toppings to assemble the bowls of their choice.To serve it as a warm winter casserole, once assembled, bake the bowl in a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes and serve hot with baked Tortilla chips.Serve the Mexican Vegetarian Burrito Bowl for a wholesome dinner followed by a dessert of Apple Enchiladas. " ;

	ex:instructions "To begin making the Dahi Bhindi Recipe, we will first roast the Bhindi .Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a Wok or a Kadai; add the chopped onions and the bhindi (okra). Sprinkle some salt and sauté the bhindi and the onions on low heat. Keep the pan covered for the few minutes so the bhindi gets cooked.When covered the bhindi releases moisture, but this moisture helps it to cook and soften as well.Once you notice that it has released a little moisture and the bhindi is slightly softened, open the pan and stir fry the bhindi until it is well roasted. Make sure you roast it on medium heat. Roast the Bhindi until you notice it has begun to shrink and has browned. It should not become sticky, slimy and gooey. If it has turned this way, add a little more oil and sprinkle some gram flour/besan and stir it gently. This will absorb the sliminess.The bhindi is a tricky vegetable to cook, so it takes some practice to not making it gooey.Once the bhindi is cooked and well roasted, keep it aside till we prepare the yogurt gravy.To make the Yogurt Curry, add the yogurt into a saucepan; add the gram flour, grated ginger, garam masala powder,  turmeric powder and chili powder. Whisk until smooth. Add in 1/4 cup of water and whisk again until well combined.Place the saucepan on a medium heat and allow the yogurt mixture to come to a brisk boil. Allow it to boil for a couple of minutes and then turn the heat to low. Simmer the mixture until the yogurt becomes thick and creamy. Once thick and creamy, add in the roasted bhindi and stir. Simmer for a few more minutes. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.Turn off the heat and transfer the Dahi Bhindi a serving bowl. The final step is to make the seasoning. Heat a tablespoon of ghee in a Tadka Pan. Add the cumin seeds, dry red chilies and roast them until lightly browned.Pour this seasoning and the caramelized onions into the Dahi Bhindi. Stir to mix gently and finally stir in the chopped coriander leaves.Serve the Dahi Bhindi along with Phulka Recipe  or Steamed Rice and  Green Moong Sprout Salad for a simple weeknight dinner or even a weekend lunch." ;

Gradually add water into the flour mixture and knead to make a soft and smooth dough.Once all the flour has come together, keep kneading for 3 to 4 minutes so the dough becomes smooth and soft. Cover the dough and keep it aside for 10 minutes till we prepare the filling for the kachori.The next step is to make the filling for the Corn and Matar Kachori.Into a food processor, add all the filling ingredients and pulse to make a coarse mixture. Once the kachori filling is ready, transfer to a bowl, check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.The next step is the roll out the dough and make the Matar Kachoris. You can either shape them as flat breads or keep it as a ball, its a personal choice.And to cook the Kachori's you can either use an Air Fryer, Bake in an Oven or Deep Fry them. I have tried all the methods and my favorite has been with the Air Fryer. The best part about using the Air Fryer is, I was able to pre-make these Kachoris in the Air Fryer and reheat it in the Air Fryer to make it crisp again.Divide the dough into 12 to 15 equal portions and roll out each dough into 2 inch diameter circles.Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of the rolled out dough. Bring all the sides of the dough together to seal the filling. Twist the dough to seal the Corn Matar Kachori well. When you bring the dough you might find some excess dough collected on the top, remove this dough.Proceed to make the remaining Matar Kachoris the similar way.You can either choose to keep the Kachori like a ball or roll the Kachori gently to make a 3 inch diameter circle. Take care when you roll, as the filling might spill out.If you are using the Air Fryer or the Oven, then preheat them at 180 C for about 15 minutes.

	ex:instructions "We begin making the Chocolate Tart Recipe by following the below procedures:Method for making the tart crustIn a large mixing bowl; combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the butter and mix the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add in a tablespoon of ice water at a time and knead to bring the flour together.Knead to form a firm dough that is firm and does not break apart when you try to press it. Make sure you only add a tablespoon of water at a time, as the warmth of your hand will help bring the flour together to form a dough. Wrap the pastry crust dough in cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out to make a circle of 12 inch diameter that is about 1/4 inch thick. Lift the dough carefully from the floured surface and place it in a 9 inch tart pan with a removable base.Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly; press the edges into the sides of the pan. It is important to press the dough evenly into every nook and corner of the pan's ring. Remove the excess dough that is hanging off the sides of the pan. Place the tart crust in the freezer for atleast another 15 minutes. This process of chilling the crust, helps make the crust flaky when baked.Prebaking the Tart CrustPreheat the oven to 180 C. Once the oven is preheated, Prick the chilled tart crust with a fork, so it does not puff up while in the oven. Cover the tart crust with foil, place pie weights or beans on the crust and prebake the crust for about 25 minutes. The tart will look golden brown but not completely baked. Remove the tart crust from the oven and allow the oven to be on at 180C.Remove the foil and pie weights/ beans and keep the crust aside while we prepare the filling.Method for Chocolate FillingWhisk the eggs in a bowl until light and flully. Keep aside.To make the chocolate filling for the tart, place the heavy cream and milk in a sauce pan over medium heat, add in the chopped chocolate and keep stirring on low heat till you see the chocolate melting half way through. Turn off the heat and proceed to melt the chocolate into the milk and cream mixture in the existing heat. Add in the sugar and salt and whisk the chocolate cream mixture until well combined.Next add in the whisked eggs into the chocolate cream mixture and whisk it in well until well combined. The chocolate cream filling mixture is now ready to be poured into the tart crust.Pour the filling into the tart crust and place it back into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy. If you see any bubbles or cracks forming on the surface, take the tart out right away as this indicates that the tart is getting overbaked.Keep monitoring the Chocolate Tart while its in the oven, as the baking times differ from oven to oven. It is important to monitor so you don't over bake the chocolate.Remove the Chocolate Tart from the oven, and allow it to cool completely. Refrigerate the Chocolate Tart for about 8 hours until set and serve it along with fresh fruits, like strawberries.Serve the Chocolate Tart Recipe as a Dessert for a Get together Party to amuse your guest." ;

Once the sugar has melted continue to boil the sugar mixture until the liquid reaches a two string consistency.To know the right consistency - do the cold water candy test. Take few tablespoons of water in a cup; add a drop of sugar syrup to water. If it holds its shape like a softball and doesn’t dissolve into water then it’s at the right consistency.Once the sugar syrup has reached the right consistency, add the ground pista and coconut mixture, the cardamom powder to the sugar syrup.With the heat on medium continue stirring frequently to prevent the mixture from sticking to the pan.In 10 to 15 minutes, the pista burfi mixture will thicken and will come away from the sides of the pan. This happens with the coconut and pista releasing its oil.At this stage turn off the heat and be careful not to stir any longer on heat as the mixture can get over cooked and will not set to the consistency required. The sugar will crystallize making the burfi very hard.Transfer the mixture on a greased square pan and spread it evenly on the top and press it down so its sets well. Allow the pista burfi to cool completely.Once cooled, cut the Pista Burfi into squares and serve.You can make the Pista Burfi as a dessert when you have guests at home or make for festivals like Holi, Diwali and Raksha Bandhan.You can also serve it after your delicious meal of Dal Makhani, Aloo Bhindi Sabzi, Palak Raita, Phulka and Jeera Rice." ;

Steam the atta for about 15 to 20 minutes.After steaming, remove the cloth from the steamer, open the ends and leave it open for few minutes until it cools down so you can handle the flour.Now break the flour as fine as you can and then sieve it to make sure no lumps are present.To the fine flour, add red chili powder, salt, white sesame seeds, ajwain, and hot melted butter. Mix everything with your fingertips until it resembles bread crumb like texture. Add water little at a time and knead. Make a soft and stiff dough and keep the dough covered and away from stove, else the dough will turn too dry.Heat oil in a wide pan on medium flame. While oil is heating, fill the press with murukku mix.Squeeze out the murukku over a greased ladle and drop them gently into the hot oil. Once you drop the murukku, turn flame to medium. Wait until the murukku releases the ladle by itself (if you find that murukku is not leaving the spotted ladle, you can gently push the murukku using another ladle after it’s cooked on one side, mine released by itself).Fry them in oil until golden brown on both side. You will notice that the bubbles in the oil is reduced which indicates murukku is down. Remove from oil and place it on a kitchen towel to absorb excess oil.Once it completely cools, store in air tight container and enjoy them for a longer time.Serve Vivatta Whole Wheat Flour Murukku with hot Adrak Chai Recipe during your tea time break. " ;

Place the beans in the pressure, place the weight on, cover the pan and cook it along with 2-1/2 cups of water. After you heat 4 to 5 whistles, turn the heat to low and cook for another 15 minutes.Turn off the heat and allow the pressure cooker to release its pressure naturally. This would take another 10 minutes. The beans continue to cook under the pressure even when it is turned off.Once the pressure is released, open the cooker and drain out the excess liquids. You store this liquid and use it in the vegetable stock or risotto.Once the beans are cooked, our next step is to spice it up to make the baked beans.Heat oil in a sauce pan on medium heat; add in the onions and garlic and give it a light sauté until the onions are tender.

Rub ghee or vegetable shortening into the flour mixture, with your fingers until it resembles loose bread crumbs.Gradually add water, slowly, and knead to make a soft but firm dough. Roll the dough into a ball, cover with a moist muslin cloth and keep aside.The next step is to make the filling. In a kadai or heavy bottomed pan, warm the ghee, add the jeera and allow it to crackle and tip in the chilli paste. Saute these together for a minute.Add peas followed by all the other spices and cook till the pea mixture becomes dry and all the water has dried up. Season with salt and cook again for 2-3 minutes. Set the peas mixture aside to cool down so it is easier to handle when shaping the samosas.Make a flour paste, by combining the flour and water.To begin making the samosa cases, divide the dough into small balls and roll them into thin circles. Cut each rolled-out circle into two halves by running your knife down the center, so you have 2 semi-circles for each disc. Roll the semi-circles into cones and using a teaspoon fill them with the peas mixture.Dab the flour paste along the edges of the open side of the cone, press the two edges together and seal. Arrange the matar samosas in a platter and cover them with a moist muslin cloth.Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai on medium heat. Deep fry the matar samosas in hot oil till they are golden brown. Try not to fry too many together as it will crowd the kadai and alter the cooking time.Remove the Matar Samosa from the kadai using a slotted spoon and drain them on kitchen paper. Matar Samosa  can be served with a dollop of Dhaniya Pudina Chutney and khajoor imli chutney or tomato ketchup, along with masala chai in the evening." .

If you are using active dry yeast (look like small round balls) - follow the instructions given in the packet.If you are using fast action yeast (looks more like fine semolina) then in a large bowl combine the flours, salt and sugar and gradually add in the yeast and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, adding little flour if it tends to get sticky. Once all of the ingredients form a ball; add the olive oil and place the ball on a work surface and knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes. Repeated kneading combines all the ingredients well and will help the bread rise well in the oven.Once you have finished kneading and gained enough arm muscle; place the dough in a large bowl coated with olive oil and cover it with cling wrap/plastic wrap and allow it to rise for about 2 hours.After two hours you will notice that the dough has doubled. At this point punch the dough down and knead gently. Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll each portion into a ball. Place the balls on a baking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth and let them sit for another 30 minutes.While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 250 C. The oven should be preheated for at least half an hour before you can bake the pitas in them. Now it should be time to work your dough into flat bread. Take one ball, dust it with a little flour and dust the work surface as well. Using a rolling pin, roll the pita into an oval or a circle. Make sure the pitas are thin; about 1/8th inch or 1/4 inch thick. Continue the same with the remaining dough balls.Place the rolled portion of pita bread on dusted baking sheets and place it inside the oven. Bake the pita dough until they puff - you will see them rising forming bubbles, to slowly puffing and fully puffing up.The whole process takes a maximum or 3-5 minutes and not more than 5 minutes. If the pita bread does not rise in 5 minutes, then take them out. The Pita Bread will still be cooked, but just wont have pockets and will still taste just as good.You can serve Whole Wheat Pita Bread Recipe along with soups or make it into sandwiches like Egg Bhurji Stuffed Pita Pockets Recipe, Aloo Tikki Stuffed Pita Sandwich Recipe, Pita Sandwich With Cauliflower Falafel And Roasted Vegetables Recipe and more." .

After an hour, wash the chopped bitter gourd thoroughly and keep aside to drain. Use a little oil and roast the bitter gourd rings on low heat in a kadai till crisp. Peel and clean the Ambade meanwhile when the bitter gourd is roasting on low heat. Heat a little oil in a kadai (a few drops each time) and lightly roast the coriander seeds, urad dal, methi seeds, rice grains, peppercorns, asafoetida piece and dry red chillies separately on low heat.As soon as each ingredient changes its colour, remove from flame and keep aside to cool.Once cooled, grind all these ingredients in a mixer grinder along with the grated coconut, using required water to form a smooth paste. Add to this paste to a cup of water and mix well to form a semi-thick gravy and pour in the kadai.Now, add turmeric powder, ambade/hog plum/amtekai, jaggery, roasted bitter gourd rings, salt to taste and keep on a high heat stirring occasionally till it reaches boiling point. Once it starts boiling, lower the heat and simmer for about 8-10 minutes or till the ambade are cooked and soft. If you feel that the gravy has thickened too much by now, just add some water to bring back a medium consistency which is desirable.Check for seasoning and adjust salt and jaggery if required. In a tadka pan, heat a bit of oil for tempering and when the oil is hot, add mustard seeds and asafoetida. Pour this over the prepared udid methi.Serve Karwar Style Ambade Udid Methi Recipe (Hog Plum Curry) along with Steamed Rice and Sol Kadhi for a South Indian meal." .

Stir well.Add Chipotle chilli along with Adobo sauce, crushed cumin and salt. If using red chilli flakes instead, add it now.Mix it all up well and cook to make a thick sauce. This may take 5-7 minutes. Turn off the heat and keep it aside.For the sautéed peppers/vegetables, place a pan on heat, add some oil to it and allow it to get warm.Once done add all the chopped peppers (or any other vegetables that you may like) along with the garlic.Sprinkle salt and sauté for 1-2 minutes. Then, add chilli flakes and oregano, toss together and turn off the heat. Keep aside till ready to use.For the roasted corn salsa, char the corn on the stove top or in a preheated oven. Take the kernels off the cob and put it in a bowl.Add in the rest of the ingredients and mix thoroughly. Keep aside until later use.For the guacamole, prepare the Avocado guacamole but remember that guacamole needs to be eaten fresh, so this is one component that has to be made last, or just before assembling and serving the burrito bowl.To assemble the burrito bowl, if you are preparing one big bowl for your guests, use a fairly deep 8-9” flat bottom bowl or serving dish.A burrito bowl is essentially layered, so begin with the coriander-lime rice. Spread it generously at the base of the bowl.Over it, spoon the spicy beans and spread it around the rice.Next, layer the sauteed peppers over the beans.On top of that goes a layer of guacamole.Spread some corn salsa over it, and top it with the lettuce (if using), cheese and black olives and serve.If you are making individual burrito bowls for a smaller crowd, follow the same sequence of layers, but use smaller sized ramekins for serving.To make a Burrito Bar, simply place all the prepared components on convenient location. Give your guests individual bowls and allow them to choose their favorite toppings to assemble the bowls of their choice.To serve it as a warm winter casserole, once assembled, bake the bowl in a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes and serve hot with baked Tortilla chips.Serve the Mexican Vegetarian Burrito Bowl for a wholesome dinner followed by a dessert of Apple Enchiladas. " .

	ex:preparationInstructions "To begin making the Dahi Bhindi Recipe, we will first roast the Bhindi .Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a Wok or a Kadai; add the chopped onions and the bhindi (okra). Sprinkle some salt and sauté the bhindi and the onions on low heat. Keep the pan covered for the few minutes so the bhindi gets cooked.When covered the bhindi releases moisture, but this moisture helps it to cook and soften as well.Once you notice that it has released a little moisture and the bhindi is slightly softened, open the pan and stir fry the bhindi until it is well roasted. Make sure you roast it on medium heat. Roast the Bhindi until you notice it has begun to shrink and has browned. It should not become sticky, slimy and gooey. If it has turned this way, add a little more oil and sprinkle some gram flour/besan and stir it gently. This will absorb the sliminess.The bhindi is a tricky vegetable to cook, so it takes some practice to not making it gooey.Once the bhindi is cooked and well roasted, keep it aside till we prepare the yogurt gravy.To make the Yogurt Curry, add the yogurt into a saucepan; add the gram flour, grated ginger, garam masala powder,  turmeric powder and chili powder. Whisk until smooth. Add in 1/4 cup of water and whisk again until well combined.Place the saucepan on a medium heat and allow the yogurt mixture to come to a brisk boil. Allow it to boil for a couple of minutes and then turn the heat to low. Simmer the mixture until the yogurt becomes thick and creamy. Once thick and creamy, add in the roasted bhindi and stir. Simmer for a few more minutes. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.Turn off the heat and transfer the Dahi Bhindi a serving bowl. The final step is to make the seasoning. Heat a tablespoon of ghee in a Tadka Pan. Add the cumin seeds, dry red chilies and roast them until lightly browned.Pour this seasoning and the caramelized onions into the Dahi Bhindi. Stir to mix gently and finally stir in the chopped coriander leaves.Serve the Dahi Bhindi along with Phulka Recipe  or Steamed Rice and  Green Moong Sprout Salad for a simple weeknight dinner or even a weekend lunch." .

You can either shape them as flat breads or keep it as a ball, its a personal choice.And to cook the Kachori's you can either use an Air Fryer, Bake in an Oven or Deep Fry them. I have tried all the methods and my favorite has been with the Air Fryer. The best part about using the Air Fryer is, I was able to pre-make these Kachoris in the Air Fryer and reheat it in the Air Fryer to make it crisp again.Divide the dough into 12 to 15 equal portions and roll out each dough into 2 inch diameter circles.Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of the rolled out dough. Bring all the sides of the dough together to seal the filling. Twist the dough to seal the Corn Matar Kachori well. When you bring the dough you might find some excess dough collected on the top, remove this dough.Proceed to make the remaining Matar Kachoris the similar way.You can either choose to keep the Kachori like a ball or roll the Kachori gently to make a 3 inch diameter circle. Take care when you roll, as the filling might spill out.If you are using the Air Fryer or the Oven, then preheat them at 180 C for about 15 minutes. Place the Kachoris in the Air Fryer Basket or the Baking sheet (for the oven) and bake until the Kachoris are golden brown and crisp on all sides.If you plan to deep fry them, then preheat the oil for deep frying. Once the oil is heated, fry the Kachoris on low to medium heat until you get a deep golden brown color and it is crisp. Once golden, drain on absorbent paper and proceed to make the remaining Kachoris the similar way.Serve these mouth watering Corn and Matar Kachoris as a tea time or evening snack along with Green Chutney and Date Chutney. You can also serve them as starter for dinner parties." .

Place the tart crust in the freezer for atleast another 15 minutes. This process of chilling the crust, helps make the crust flaky when baked.Prebaking the Tart CrustPreheat the oven to 180 C. Once the oven is preheated, Prick the chilled tart crust with a fork, so it does not puff up while in the oven. Cover the tart crust with foil, place pie weights or beans on the crust and prebake the crust for about 25 minutes. The tart will look golden brown but not completely baked. Remove the tart crust from the oven and allow the oven to be on at 180C.Remove the foil and pie weights/ beans and keep the crust aside while we prepare the filling.Method for Chocolate FillingWhisk the eggs in a bowl until light and flully. Keep aside.To make the chocolate filling for the tart, place the heavy cream and milk in a sauce pan over medium heat, add in the chopped chocolate and keep stirring on low heat till you see the chocolate melting half way through. Turn off the heat and proceed to melt the chocolate into the milk and cream mixture in the existing heat. Add in the sugar and salt and whisk the chocolate cream mixture until well combined.Next add in the whisked eggs into the chocolate cream mixture and whisk it in well until well combined. The chocolate cream filling mixture is now ready to be poured into the tart crust.Pour the filling into the tart crust and place it back into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy. If you see any bubbles or cracks forming on the surface, take the tart out right away as this indicates that the tart is getting overbaked.Keep monitoring the Chocolate Tart while its in the oven, as the baking times differ from oven to oven. It is important to monitor so you don't over bake the chocolate.Remove the Chocolate Tart from the oven, and allow it to cool completely. Refrigerate the Chocolate Tart for about 8 hours until set and serve it along with fresh fruits, like strawberries.Serve the Chocolate Tart Recipe as a Dessert for a Get together Party to amuse your guest." .

Once the sugar has melted continue to boil the sugar mixture until the liquid reaches a two string consistency.To know the right consistency - do the cold water candy test. Take few tablespoons of water in a cup; add a drop of sugar syrup to water. If it holds its shape like a softball and doesn’t dissolve into water then it’s at the right consistency.Once the sugar syrup has reached the right consistency, add the ground pista and coconut mixture, the cardamom powder to the sugar syrup.With the heat on medium continue stirring frequently to prevent the mixture from sticking to the pan.In 10 to 15 minutes, the pista burfi mixture will thicken and will come away from the sides of the pan. This happens with the coconut and pista releasing its oil.At this stage turn off the heat and be careful not to stir any longer on heat as the mixture can get over cooked and will not set to the consistency required. The sugar will crystallize making the burfi very hard.Transfer the mixture on a greased square pan and spread it evenly on the top and press it down so its sets well. Allow the pista burfi to cool completely.Once cooled, cut the Pista Burfi into squares and serve.You can make the Pista Burfi as a dessert when you have guests at home or make for festivals like Holi, Diwali and Raksha Bandhan.You can also serve it after your delicious meal of Dal Makhani, Aloo Bhindi Sabzi, Palak Raita, Phulka and Jeera Rice." .

Do not pile the eggs one on top of another. Also, also make sure that the water level is about inches above the eggs, failing which the gradual evaporation of water during rolling boil will leave the eggs imperfectly cooked and eggs may develop a greenish layer.Keep the saucepan on medium heat and let the water boil. Boil the contents for 8-12 minutes with or without covering the pan. If you need soft boiled eggs, switch off at 8 minutes; or you can continue to boil eggs for 12 minutes for perfectly cooked hard boiled eggs.You can immediately take the eggs out from a slotted spoon and put them in ice cold water to curb further cooking.Peel off the skin, cut to half, season with salt and pepper and the boiled eggs recipe is good to be eaten.These boiled eggs can also be included in making Nargisi Kofta Recipe, Egg Roast Curry Recipe or in making simple Stuffed Deviled Eggs with Parsley and Mayonnaise." .
